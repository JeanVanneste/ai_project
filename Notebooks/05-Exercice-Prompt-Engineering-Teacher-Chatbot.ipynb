    "# Exercise: Prompt Engineering — Teacher Chatbot for Primary School\n",
    "\n",
    "- Author: Martin Fockedey with the help of copilote\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary school wants to deploy a chatbot to help students (ages 6-11) with their homework. The chatbot must be:\n",
    "- **Educational**: Guide students to find answers themselves rather than giving direct solutions\n",
    "- **Age-appropriate**: Use simple language and concepts suitable for young learners\n",
    "- **Safe**: Avoid inappropriate content and maintain a supportive tone\n",
    "- **Pedagogical**: Encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "The school has identified common homework scenarios:\n",
    "1. Math problems (arithmetic, word problems, basic geometry)\n",
    "2. Reading comprehension questions\n",
    "3. Spelling and vocabulary\n",
    "4. Science questions (nature, simple experiments)\n",
    "5. General study tips and organization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task**: Design a well-engineered prompt for this chatbot following best practices from the previous notebook ans insuring use alignement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Use**: Please don't use LLM's to write your prompts (metaprompting) the goal here is for you to try and explore prompt engineering!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this exercise, you will:\n",
    "- Apply prompt engineering techniques to a real-world educational scenario\n",
    "- Balance multiple constraints (pedagogy, safety, tone, age-appropriateness)\n",
    "- Design prompts that guide behavior without over-constraining creativity\n",
    "- Test and iterate on prompt quality\n",
    "- Understand the importance of context and persona in specialized applications"
